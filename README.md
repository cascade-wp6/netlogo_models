Netlogo implementation of Cellular automata
===================================

Netlogo is a user-friendly simulation environment for agent based models that can be used for cellular automata as well. 

Netlogo can be used to communicate and explore the dynamics, since the user can modify the parameter settings live and see directly how the model responds. 

We want to populate this repository with a series of models that are useful for:

- exploring the model dynamics of the basic versions of the models developed within CASCADE
- "games" that allow to communicate the complexity of the dynamics in arid shrublands under different sources of pressure (like drought, grazing, or fire). 
  

## Install

First, you need to install NetLogo
